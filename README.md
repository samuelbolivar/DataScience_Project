# Data Science Projects

## What is in here?

Make sure you have completed any labs that you might have missed or didn't finish.

* I have completed the labs and got some questions :)

### Homework - Due July 8th, 2016

* For the following use the github repository you made for your project. 
* Load some data you have gathered for your project into Python.
* Identify some numeric and categorical features in your data. Write this up in a file called README.md 
* Run some summary statistics over the numeric data.
* Are there any interesting features of the data that jump out?
* Generate some data visualisations that would be useful for you to explore your data set, particularly the numeric data right now.
* If you can find any good candidates for a regression, try some regressors out.
* When you are ready to submit, create a branch in your repository.
* Send a message on Slack to Greg and Adrian to remind us of your repository name. Also tell us the name of the branch, and the filename of the jupyter notebook where you've done all this work
* (You can keep working on your project after this; Adrian and I will be looking at a static branch)

### Insights

* I have placed the Data files in the folder named "Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn"
* Inside that directory there is the iPython Notebook named "Movie's Reviews Sentiment Analysis.ipynb"
* I could identify from the Data Set that 12500 reviews are classified as positive and 12500 reviews are categorised as negative
* When separating the data to positive and negative reviews, the index is not continuous on resulting data frames; this coudl be a prblem and I will try to adress it
* I used textblob to run a sentiment analysis on 2 sample reviews and it does give good indication, however polatiry and subjetivity have some low values. Maybe I am not used yet to them.
* Created some wordcloud for the sample reviews and tried to do a dispersion plot to see where do the words are located
* I am planning to include Alchemy and word2vec from Google.
